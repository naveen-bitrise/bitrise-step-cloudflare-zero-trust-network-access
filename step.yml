  Cloudflare Zero Trust Network Access
summary: |
  Bitrise Step for Connecting to Cloudflare Zero Trust Network using Service Tokens. 
description: |
  Connect to Cloudflare Zero Trust Network using Service Tokens. 

  ## Prerequisites
  - You should have a Service Token (Client ID and Client Secret) created in Cloudflare Zero Trust
  - *Service Auth* should be configured (with the Service Token) as an allowed authentication method to the Access policy protecting your application in Cloudflare Zero Trust

  ## Limitations of accessing using Service Tokens

  #### What Service Tokens CAN Reach
  - Applications protected by Cloudflare Access policies
  - Services with hostnames configured in Access
  - HTTP/HTTPS endpoints behind Access

  #### What Service Tokens CANNOT Reach
  - **Non-HTTP protocols** (SSH, RDP, databases, etc.) - even if they have hostnames
  - Services using arbitrary TCP/UDP ports
  - Direct network-layer access (like traditional VPN access to internal IPs)
